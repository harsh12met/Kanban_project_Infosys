# Add New Column Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented the "Add New Column" feature which allows users to add custom columns to the Kanban board. Users can click a "+" button in the corner of any column to add a new column immediately after it.

## Changes Made

### 1. Task Service (task.service.ts)

- Updated `Task` interface to use string-based status instead of fixed enum
- Updated `Column` interface to include an `order` property and use string-based ID
- Added new storage key for columns: `COLUMNS_STORAGE_KEY`
- Added methods to manage columns:
  - `addColumn(title, afterColumnId)`: Adds a new column after a specified column
  - `deleteColumn(columnId)`: Removes a column and reassigns its tasks
  - `updateColumn(columnId, title)`: Updates a column's title
  - `reorderColumns(columnId, newOrder)`: Changes the order of columns
- Modified `getTasksByColumns()` to dynamically build columns based on stored data
- Updated `moveTask()` to accept any string as column ID

### 2. Board Component (board.component.ts)

- Added properties to manage column addition UI:
  - `showAddColumn`: Controls visibility of the add column form
  - `newColumnTitle`: Two-way binding for the column title input
  - `selectedColumnId`: Tracks which column the new one will be added after
- Added methods:
  - `addColumn()`: Calls the service to add a new column
  - `openAddColumnForm(columnId)`: Shows the form and sets the selected column
  - `cancelAddColumn()`: Hides the form and resets state

### 3. Column Component (column.component.ts)

- Changed `columnId` input from enum to string type
- Added new `addColumnRequested` output EventEmitter
- Added `requestAddColumn()` method to emit the event when "+" is clicked

### 4. HTML Templates

- Added "+" button to column headers in column.component.html
- Added add column form modal to board.component.html with:
  - Text input for the column title
  - Add and Cancel buttons

### 5. CSS Updates

- Added styles for the "+" button in column headers
- Added styles for the add column form modal
- Added animation for the modal appearance

### 6. Documentation

- Created `ADD-NEW-COLUMN-GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions and best practices

## How to Use

1. Click the "+" button in the top-right corner of any column
2. Enter a name for your new column in the modal that appears
3. Click "Add Column" to create the column
4. The new column will appear after the column where you clicked the "+" button
5. You can drag tasks to/from the new column just like the default columns

## Technical Notes

- Column data persists in localStorage using the key "kanban-columns"
- Each column has a unique string ID ("col1", "col2", etc.)
- Order property ensures columns display in the correct sequence
- Default columns (todo, inprogress, done) are preserved
- All drag-drop functionality works with the new columns

## Future Enhancements

1. Add ability to delete custom columns
2. Add ability to reorder columns via drag and drop
3. Add color customization for columns
4. Allow setting WIP (Work In Progress) limits for columns

## Testing

The feature can be tested by:

1. Running the application
2. Clicking the "+" button on any column
3. Creating a new column
4. Verifying it appears in the correct position
5. Testing drag-drop functionality with the new column
6. Refreshing the page to ensure persistence
