# Task Reordering Feature Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Task Reordering Within Same Column

### 🎯 Feature Overview

Successfully implemented drag and drop functionality that allows users to reorder tasks within the same column while preserving all existing features.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Task Interface Enhancement**

- Added `order: number` property to the Task interface
- Ensures proper sequencing of tasks within columns

#### 2. **TaskService Updates**

- **reorderTasksInColumn()** method added for handling within-column task reordering
- Enhanced addTask() method to automatically assign order values
- Modified getTasksByColumns() to sort tasks by order within each column
- All changes preserve existing functionality (add, edit, delete, move between columns)

#### 3. **ColumnComponent Enhancements**

- **onDragOverAtIndex()** - Handles drag over events at specific positions
- **onDropAtIndex()** - Handles dropping tasks at specific positions within the column
- Enhanced drag and drop event handling for within-column reordering
- Maintains existing cross-column drag and drop functionality

#### 4. **UI/UX Improvements**

- **Drop zones** added above and below each task for precise positioning
- **Visual feedback** during drag operations with highlighted drop zones
- **Smooth transitions** and hover effects for better user experience
- **CSS styling** for drop zones with proper visual indicators

#### 5. **HTML Template Updates**

- Added drop zone divs with proper event handlers
- Maintained existing task rendering with drag and drop support
- Enhanced template structure for better drag and drop experience

### 🚀 Key Features Working

#### ✅ NEW: Within-Column Task Reordering

- Drag tasks up or down within the same column
- Visual drop zones show valid drop positions
- Order persists after page refresh via localStorage

#### ✅ PRESERVED: All Existing Features

- ✅ Add new tasks to Todo column
- ✅ Edit task title, description, and priority
- ✅ Delete tasks with confirmation
- ✅ Move tasks between columns (Todo → In Progress → Done)
- ✅ Priority system (High, Medium, Low) with color coding
- ✅ Task count display in column headers
- ✅ localStorage persistence
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Real-time updates across components

### 🎮 How to Test

1. **Start the application**: Server running on http://localhost:4201
2. **Add multiple tasks** to the Todo column using the + button
3. **Drag a task** within the same column - drop zones will appear
4. **Drop the task** in a new position
5. **Verify order change** - tasks should reorder correctly
6. **Refresh page** - order should persist
7. **Test in other columns** by moving tasks to In Progress and Done first
